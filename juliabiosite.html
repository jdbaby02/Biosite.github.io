      <h3 style= "font-size: 20px" align="center"><strong>ABOUT JULIA</strong></h3>
      <p>I am 28 years old, born in the month of August  in Nebraska. I was raised by my mother, Jen and currently live in Council Bluffs. I have two older siblings, Jasn and Jessica, which in return, come with many nieces and nephews. Something I find pretty unique is the fact that James' siblings names are also Jessica and Jason, and my mother is a twin and so is James! I attended ALHS where I graduated in 2009. I have a family of five, which consist of my two children, fiancé James, and our dog, Charlie. We still reside in the Council Bluffs area where I am currently a stay-at-home mom and waitress part-time, while my fiancé James is a teacher and soccer coach at Lewis Central High School.</p>
      <p>As a mother, daughter,  fiancé, friend and sister I wear many hats. In my spare time, I like to cheer on my favorite sports teams, I like to be in touch with my spiritual side, I like to get outside, I enjoy crafting things and I am very fashionable. I would like to take the time below to explain some of the hats I wear, along with the hobbies I enjoy when I get the time to do so.</p>

      <h4>OUTDOORSY</h4>
      <p>In my off time, I enjoy bicycle rides, walking or going on a good hike. Luckily we have access to the Pedestrian Bridge, Bicycle Trails, and many places to to hike. Both my kids also like doing these things, so I know I always have pals I can count on to tag along with me and keep me company.</p>

      <h4>SPORTS FAN</h4>
      <p>I’m a Hawkeyes, Vikings, and Laker fan, however I don’t keep up with sports as much as I should. I am more of a cheerleader, to be there supporting the team through hoorays, and wearing all the gear. And it kind of comes as a default when your significant other is a huge sports fan. </p>

      <h4>SPIRITUAL</h4>
      <p>I consider myself an empath, and someone who relates to people more on a soul level. I find I enjoy things that bring you back to the mind, body, and soul through natural healing and positive thoughts. I have a psychic/medium I follow frequently, that I really admire, as she emits a positive message, while still telling you the truth you need to hear.</p>

      <h4>FASHIONISTA</h4>
      <p>I like to think I have cute style, and try to keep up with the trends, while still embellishing my own touches. Sometimes my fiancé likes to think I dress like a hippie, or “weird”, but he doesn’t know what style is. I also have slight OCD, so I like to ensure everyone’s clothes have some type of coordination to it, or at least mesh well. </p>

      <h4>CRAFTER</h4>
      <p>This is my favorite off time hobby. I have always had a creative side, and enjoyed all things art and crafts both as a child, and in my adulthood. My son Jaxson actually follows my lead in having a creative side, too. I own a crafting machine called a Cricut that I like to utilize when crafting up projects, especially those more meticulous things. I hope to one day make more out of this hobby, than just simply crafting.</p>

      <h4>MOTHER</h4>
      <p>I am a mother to two boys, who are six years apart. Our oldest, Jaxson is nine years old, and Jayce, our youngest, three years old. Jaxson keeps me busy, as he is an avid athlete playing in multiple sports, as well as staying on top of the books by excelling in school. Although Jayce is three, he is mighty. He is a tornado, never slowing down, but we wouldn’t have it any other way. My kids are my biggest pride and joy. </p>
